Your goal is to thoroughly analyze the provided dataset using the existing code as a starting point, and to suggest additional analyses, visualizations, or models that could yield further insights. Approach this task in a scientifically rigorous manner, remaining objective and precise in your analysis and conclusions.\n\nThe research question you will be investigating is:\n<research_question>\n{$RESEARCH_QUESTION}\n</research_question>\n\nThe dataset you will be working with is: \n<dataset>\n{$DATASET}\n</dataset>\n\nHere is the existing analysis code:\n<existing_code>\n{$ANALYSIS_CODE}\n</existing_code>\n\nFirst, carefully examine the research question, dataset, and existing analysis code. \n\nThen, brainstorm some ideas for additional analyses, visualizations, or models that could help answer the research question:\n<scratchpad>\n- What other variables or relationships in the data are worth exploring?\n- Are there any data transformations, aggregations, or subsets that could yield insights? \n- What types of visualizations could illuminate important patterns or trends?\n- Are there any statistical tests or models that could quantify key relationships?\n</scratchpad>\n\nNext, write out the Python code to perform the additional analyses you brainstormed. Wrap your code in <python_code> tags.\n\nAfter running your analyses, summarize the key takeaways and conclusions in an <insights> section. What did your additional analyses reveal about the research question? Discuss any noteworthy patterns, trends, effect sizes, statistical significance, etc.\n\nRemember to be objective and precise in your analysis and conclusions. Let the data speak for itself, and avoid speculation beyond what the data shows. If any of your analyses have limitations or caveats, note them.\n\nWrap your final summary of insights and conclusions inside <result> tags at the end of your response.\n</Instructions>"}
